<h1><center><font size="34">Why Vote Layla Brown?</font></center></h1>

<center>Layla's goals for Nj include: more tacos, faster delivery, warmer weather, music events, and more.</center>

<h2><center>More tacos/Faster Food Delievery</center></h2>

<center>Tacos and food in general are very important.Slow delievery can result in anarcy. Everyone is hanrgy waiting for food to be delievered and its just a bad sitution. Tacos are an important food, they are tasty and will have endless possiblities. Faster delievery can be started with reform in restaurants. That way there is faster delievery and very few cancled orders. </center>

<h2><center>Warmer Weather</center></h2>

<center>You may be thinking, "How can Layla change the weather?" Well im just built different so its fine. I will alter the weather to bring warm weather to the to the places that need it and colder weather to the places that are suffering from global warming. Once again because I can.</center>

<h2><center>Music Events</center></h2>

<center>Music makes everyone happy, and if it doesn't if your thinking to yourself "I don't like music" I don't want your vote. Music helps people be their best selves. Music events will help better New Jersey.

<h2><center>And More!</center></h2>
<center>I am open to everyone's ideas and opinions. The citizens of New Jersey are what make New Jersey so amazing. I vow to use your suggestions to better New Jersey.</center>
